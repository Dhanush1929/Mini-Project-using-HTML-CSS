                <p>Kerala, fondly known as 'God's Own Country', offers stunning landscapes with its backwaters, hills,
                    beaches, and rich traditions. The state's blend of culture, nature, and history makes it a

                <h2>History of Kerala</h2>
                <p>Kerala is first mentioned <em>(as Keralaputra) </em>in a 3rd-century-bce rock inscription left by the
                    Mauryan
                    emperor Ashoka. In the last centuries bce this region became famous among the Greeks and Romans for
                    its spices<em> (especially pepper).</em>
                    <br><br>
                    During the first five centuries ce the region was a part of Tamilakam—the territory of the
                    Tamils—and thus was sometimes partially controlled by the eastern Pandya and Chola dynasties, as
                    well as by the Cheras. In the 1st century Jewish immigrants arrived, and, according to local
                    Christian tradition, St. Thomas the Apostle visited Kerala in the same.
                    <br><br>
                    Much of Kerala’s history from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure, but it is known that Arab
                    traders introduced Islam later in the period. Under the Kulashekhara dynasty (c. 800–1102),
                    Malayalam emerged as a distinct language, and Hinduism became prominent.<br><br>
                    The Cholas often controlled Kerala during the 11th and 12th centuries. By the beginning of the 14th
                    century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara of the Venad kingdom established a short-lived supremacy over
                    southern India. After his death, Kerala became a conglomeration of warring chieftaincies, among
                    which the most important were Calicut<em> (now Kozhikode) </em>in the north and Venad in the south.
                    <br><br>
                    The era of foreign intervention began in 1498, when Vasco da Gama landed near Calicut. In the 16th
                    century the Portuguese superseded the Arab traders and dominated the commerce of the Malabar Coast.
                    Their attempt to establish sovereignty was thwarted by the zamorin<em> (hereditary ruler) </em>of
                    Calicut.
                    <br><br>
                    The Dutch ousted the Portuguese in the 17th century. Marthanda Varma ascended the Venad throne in
                    1729 and crushed Dutch expansionist designs at the ,Battle of Kolachel 12 years later. Marthanda
                    Varma then adopted a European mode of martial discipline and expanded the Venad domain to encompass
                    what became the southern state of Travancore.
                    <br><br>
                    His alliance in 1757 with the raja of the central state of Cochin (Kochi), against the zamorin,
                    enabled Cochin to survive. By 1806, however, Cochin and Travancore, as well as the Malabar Coast in
                    the north, had become subject states under the British Madras Presidency.<br><br>
                    Two years after India’s independence was achieved in 1947, Cochin and Travancore were united as
                    Travancore-Cochin state. The present state of Kerala was constituted on a linguistic basis in 1956
                    when the Malabar Coast and the Kasargod taluka<em> (administrative subdivision) </em>of South Kanara
                    were
                    added to Travancore-Cochin.
                    The southern portion of the former Travancore-Cochin state was attached to Tamil Nadu.
